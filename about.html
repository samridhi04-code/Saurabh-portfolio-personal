<div class="soni"><h1>SAURABH <div> SONI </div></h1><p class="quote">"I always seek for opportunities to improve my qualities.I try to learn from difficcult situations rather than running away from them,after all the best teachers in our life are our mistakes and our hardships which teach us that we should live strongly and keep going no matter what the situation is.For me life without hardships is more miserable because in order to rise up and become successful we need to fall.Learning is always fun for me,it's kind of an adventure for me to learn new things and gain expertise in it and hence I am always looking forward to learn the newest skills which seem to be appealing to me.I don't want to limit my knowledge and I want to achieve the best version of myselves." </p></div>





<div class="linea">If you guys really want to know more about me then first of all make yourselves comfortable and go through the brief intoduction I am going to give now. The very first thing you all will probably want to know is where I was born and how exactly I spent my childhood.I am not going to dive deeper into my life details but here I will be giving a brief detail about my life before the college. So, I was born in Fatehpur and I completed my intermediate from a boarding school in Kanpur.  </div><br/>
<div class="lineb">I have been very interested in the field of technology ever since I was conscious enough to understand these things.I believe that technology is not only about coding and developing instead it's about making some contribution to mankind in such a way that  would in some way, bring advancement and betterment in the life of each and every person in this world.I believe in practical knowledge more than in theoretical so I keep working on diffrenet personal projects to enhance my knowledge and my skills. I am a very hard-working person and I have good leadership qualities. I also have some job experinces. I used to teach high school students maths and science for almost a year,then I worked online as a content writer and did some other online jobs as a part time. I have some impressive skills in the field of photo and video  editing and I also work on some programming languages like python,javascript etc. Currently I am working on arduino based projects and I am an IOT developer in an organization named 'Codebugged'.
</div><br/>
<div class="linec">Apart from my technological and professional interests,I have some personal interests which keep me entertained and help me handle my work-life stress and also make me think more creatively.These are sketching and photography.I have been practicing both sketching and photography for almost 3 to 4 years and now I have become quite good in both these fields but I think I still need to learn a lot and practice them more to become more and more better.These are not just time-pass activities for me but are my passion which kind of drive me to do something useful with my time. I also play football and for now I am a beginner in it but I would personally suggest to each and everyone that being engaged in some kind of sports really helps a lot in working especially when your work involves a lot of brain-involvement.  </div><br/>
<div class="lined ">Now I think that I have provided all the useful information about myselves without loosing a bit of interest of all the readers reading this section.I hope my work is worth catching the attention of all the people viewing my portfolio and I will keep working more and more and will keep updating my work here, on my portfolio.Thank you for spending your useful time in reading about me and I hope it was worth your precious time. </div>
